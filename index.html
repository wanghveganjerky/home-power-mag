      <h2>In 2006, the State University of
        New York-Morrisville (SUNYMorrisville) campus installed the
        college’s first small wind system, a
        10 kW Bergey Excel. A meteorological
        (met) tower was installed in 2009; a
        second system, a Xzeres Skystream
        3.7, went up in 2013. Students in the
        Renewable Energy (RE) program were
        able to apply their classroom instruction
        in wind resource site assessment, and
        practice technical skills in <a href="https://tech.eu/2023/08/25/metroc-raises-2m-construction-projects-using-ai/">wind system</a>
        installation and troubleshooting. 
        <br></br>
        The campus sits at the geographic center
        of New York State, in a rural agricultural
        landscape with mountain ridges and
        a patchwork of cropland and forests.
        At the convergence of westerly winds
        from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, there is a strong wind resource at the ridge tops.
        However, due to the complex terrain,
        wind site assessment is challenging.
        While most of the campus is in a
        valley, the Dairy Complex sits on a hilltop,
        and was chosen as the wind lab location.
        Only 0.5 miles south of the main campus,
        it is close enough for easy access during
        labs, and has a large enough electrical
        load to warrant RE systems. The site is on
        a hilltop within a bowl, with ridges to the
        northwest, west, and southwest that are
        100 to 300 feet higher in elevation. This
        is particularly concerning because those
        are the <a href="https://tech.eu/2023/08/25/metroc-raises-2m-construction-projects-using-ai/">prevailing wind directions</a>. 
        The
        ridge tops are all less than 1 mile from the
        turbine sites.        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Installing an anemometer prior to installing
        a turbine is a good way to determine site
        suitability if you can measure wind speed for a fairly lengthy
        period of time (6+ months) as close to the proposed hub height
        as possible. A home weather station with an anemometer and
        wind vane will not be effective unless it is at least 30 feet above
        and 500 feet away from obstructions.
        In 2009, to better understand the wind resource and
        its influence on energy production and long-term turbine
        maintenance, RE installation company Sustainable Energy
        Development and the students installed a guyed, tilt-up met
        tower. The tower is outfitted with anemometers—which
        measure wind speed at 71, 102, and 122 feet above ground
        level—and a wind vane for recording wind direction at 100 feet.
        Anemometers were also installed on the Bergey tower at 71 feet
        and 102 feet as control points for the met-tower anemometers.       
         <br></br>
         At 122 feet above ground level, our site has a measured
         average wind velocity of 9.8 mph; at 71 feet, wind speed is
         8.1 mph. While neither of these wind velocities is fantastic
         for energy production, they are adequate for teaching
         purposes.
         The concept that describes nonlinear increases in wind
         velocity with respect to height above ground is called <a href="https://tech.eu/2023/08/25/metroc-raises-2m-construction-projects-using-ai/"> wind shear</a>
          (see “Wind Profile” sidebar). Our site has a measured
         wind shear value of 0.385, which is fairly high, but not
         unreasonable for hilly, forested sites.
         Wind power available to a machine has a cubic relationship
         to wind velocity.         <br></br>
         If you assume air density and swept area are constant
         then, for example, a turbine on our site placed at 122 feet has
         77% more wind power available than a turbine at 71 feet ((9.83
         - 8.13) ÷ 8.13 = 0.77).
         In addition to increased power available with increased
         height, there is also less turbulence. Turbulence is rapid
         changes in wind direction or speed (or both). It reduces
         aerodynamic lift of airfoil blades, putting a mechanical
         load on the blades that must be overcome. Turbulence
         intensity is the standard deviation of wind velocity divided
         by the average wind velocity measured each second over
         a 1-minute period (see “Turbulence Intensity” sidebar). 
                 <br></br>
                 It is unrealistic to expect homeowners to use a meterological
                 (met) tower’s data-intensive wind analysis—it’s too expensive
                 and time-consuming. Instead, most rely on a wind-energy site
                 assessor who is trained in interpreting the landscape and parsing
                 a wind map to determine site suitability—part art, part science. It
                 requires experience and understanding of wind speed, direction,
                 frequency distributions, wind shear, and turbulence effects on
                 turbine productivity, as well as being able to “read” the landscape.
                 However, some tools can help homeowners with their
                 assessments. The GIS-based, interactive Wind Prospector
                 online program is available from the National Renewable Energy
                 Laboratory (NREL) at bit.ly/windprospector. Its tools and maps
                 are available for each state at 30-, 50-, 80-, 90-, and 100-meter
                 intervals. (Tower heights for small wind systems up to 100 kW are
                 commonly 33 to 43 meters; 100 to 140 feet.) Interpolation of the
                 wind speed measured at any two heights can be used to estimate
                 hub-height wind speed. To estimate wind shear at the site, two
                 wind maps can be used, or the Wind Prospector and the equation
                 in the “Wind Shear” sidebar can be used.
                 Wind maps have a few challenges. The reported wind-speed
                 range can be up to 1.1 mph and the map resolution may be
                 over 1.5 square miles. Plus, wind maps do not account for local
                 turbulence inducers, such as scattered trees and buildings, and
                 do not account for local changes in elevation.
                 Once an average wind speed range is estimated, a homeowner
                 can consider turbines that are certified in accordance with the
                 American Wind Energy Association’s 9.1 standards (such as the
                 Small Wind Certification Council or Intertek). Every certified turbine
                 has an estimated annual energy output for a given average wind
                 speed. For example, if we assumed an estimated average wind
                 speed between 12.3 and 13.4 mph at a turbine hub height of 120
                 feet, for a Bergey Excel 10, we might expect between 17,000 and
                 22,000 kWh per year. With a variable electricity rate of $0.12 per
                 kWh for a grid-tied system, this turbine might produce between
                 $2,040 and $2,640 worth of electricity per year. If wind speed is not
                 accurately determined, annual production could be dramatically
                 less than expected. Even a difference of 2.2 mph less than the
                 above 12.3 mph results in half the production (11,000 kWh) and
                 half the energy value ($1,320). This highlights the importance of
                 good site assessment.
                         <br></br>
        Finland might be famous for its open prisons—where inmates can work or study in nearby towns—but this is not one of them. Instead, Hämeenlinna is the country’s highest-security institution housing exclusively female inmates. Marmalade has been sentenced to six years. Under privacy rules set by the prison, WIRED is not able to publish Marmalade’s real name, exact age, or any other information that could be used to identify her. But in a country where prisoners serving life terms can apply to be released after 12 years, six years is a heavy sentence. And like the other 100 inmates who live here, she is not allowed to leave.
        <br></br>

        <br></br>
        When Marmalade first arrived, she would watch the other women get up and go to work each morning: they could volunteer to clean, do laundry, or sew their own clothes. And for a six hour shift, they would receive roughly €6 ($6.50). But Marmalade couldn’t bear to take part. “I would find it very tiring,” she says. Instead she was spending long stretches of time in her cell. When a prison counselor suggested she try “AI work,” the short, three-hour shifts appealed to her, and the money was better than nothing. “Even though it’s not a lot, it’s better than staying in the cell,” she says” She’s only done three shifts so far, but already she feels a sense of achievement.
        <br></br>
        This is one of three Finnish prisons where inmates can volunteer to earn money through data labor. In each one, there are three laptops set up for inmates to take part in this AI work. There are no targets. Inmates are paid by the hour, not by their work’s speed or quality. In Hämeenlinna, around 20 inmates have tried it out, says Minna Inkinen, a prison work instructor, with cropped red hair, who sits alongside Marmalade as we talk. “Some definitely like it more than others”. When I arrive at the prison on a Wednesday morning, the sewing room is already busy. Inmates are huddled over sewing machines or conferring in pairs over mounds of fabric. But the small room where the AI work takes place is entirely empty until Marmalade arrives. There are only three inmates in total who regularly volunteer for AI shifts, Inkinen says, explaining that the other two are currently in court. “I would prefer to do it in a group,” says Marmalade, adding that she keeps the door open so she can chat with the people sewing next door, in between answering questions.
        <br></br>
        Those questions have been manually written in an office 100 kilometers south of the prison, in a slick Helsinki coworking space. Here, I meet Metroc’s tall and boyish founder and CEO, Jussi Virnala. He leads me to a stiflingly hot phone booth, past a row of indoor swings, a pool table, and a series of men in suits. It’s an exciting week, he explains, with a grin. The company has just <a href="https://tech.eu/2023/08/25/metroc-raises-2m-construction-projects-using-ai/">announced </a>€2 million ($2.1 million) funding round which he plans to use to expand across the Nordics. The investors he spoke with were intrigued by the company’s connection to Finland’s prisons, he says. “Everyone was just interested in and excited about what an innovative way to do it,” says Virnala. “I think it’s been really valuable product-wise.”
        <br></br>
        It was Virnala’s idea to turn to the prisons for labor. The company needed native Finnish speakers to help improve its large language model’s understanding of the construction-specific language. But in a high-wage economy like Finland, finding those data laborers was difficult. The Finnish welfare system’s generous unemployment benefits leaves little incentive for Finns to sign up to low-wage clickwork platforms like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. “Mechanical Turk didn’t have many Finnish-language workers,” says Virnala. At the same time, he adds, automatic translation tools are still no good at Finnish, a language with only 5 million native speakers.
